# FileWall
Tool for making firewall around files.
Have rules like usual firewalls.

Contains several parts:
* Driver (driver minifilter)
* Service (for fetcing data from driver)
* Client (fancy client in old Outpost style)

Basically this is the first project that given me understanding of ring zero, remoting (yes I'm old, son), windows services and some windows forms.

Please beware! Project doesn't compile now.
Lot of stuff is removed from the project because of copyright - especially resouces. I will add my own stuff later.
Even if you have chance to compile driver - please don't try it your working machine.
